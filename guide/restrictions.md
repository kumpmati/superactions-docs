# Restrictions

## Serializable values

Both the return value of an action and the parameters that you pass to that action from the client must be JSON serializable. This means that you can't pass in (or return) functions or other special data types such as Date, Map, Set, etc.

## Single-argument only

Actions cannot have more than 1 argument passed into them. This is mostly because it makes the library's types easier. You should instead use an object containing all the necessary arguments as keys.

## Route parameter types

The `RequestHandler` type is a type generated by SvelteKit for each route, and it contains type information about the available parameters and the current path.

The library is still in an early state, and doesn't yet have support for overriding the generic `RequestHandler` type used internally, so actions don't have full type information about the available parameters.
