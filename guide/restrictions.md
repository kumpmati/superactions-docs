# Restrictions

## Serializable values

Both the return value of an action, and the parameters that you pass to that action from the client must be JSON serializable. This means that you can't pass in functions or special data types such as Date, Map, Set, etc.

## Only one argument

Actions cannot have more than 1 argument passed into them. This is mostly because it makes the library's types easier.

## Route parameter types

The library is still in an early state, and doesn't yet have support for overriding the generic `RequestHandler` type used internally. This type is autogenerated by SvelteKit for each route, and contains type information about the available parameters and the current path.
